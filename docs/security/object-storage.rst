From `OpenStack Security Guide\: Object Storage`_:

  *OpenStack Object Storage (swift) is a service that provides software
  that stores and retrieves data over HTTP. Objects (blobs of data)
  are stored in an organizational hierarchy that offers anonymous
  read-only access, ACL defined access, or even temporary
  access. Object Store supports multiple token-based authentication
  mechanisms implemented via middleware.*

.. NOTE::
   Does not apply. We are not using Swift.
