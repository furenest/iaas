From `OpenStack Security Guide\: System documentation`_:

  *Documentation should provide a general description of the OpenStack
  environment and cover all systems used (production, development,
  test, etc.). Documenting system components, networks, services, and
  software often provides the birdâ€™s-eye view needed to thoroughly
  cover and consider security concerns, attack vectors and possible
  security domain bridging points. A system inventory may need to
  capture ephemeral resources such as virtual machines or virtual disk
  volumes that would otherwise be persistent resources in a
  traditional IT system.*

The NREC infrastructure is, from hardware and up, managed
completely by the NREC group, and therefore independent of each
institution. Except for networking interface and physical hardware
management, there are no dependencies on the institutions. Links to
infrastructure documentation:

``[PASS]`` **Hardware inventory**
  A high-level view of the hardware inventory is outlined in the
  document `Physical hardware`_.

``[PASS]`` **Software inventory**
  A high-level view of the software inventory is outlined in the
  document `Virtual machines`_.

``[PASS]`` **Network topology**
  A high-level view of the network topology is outlined in the
  document `Networking overview`_.
